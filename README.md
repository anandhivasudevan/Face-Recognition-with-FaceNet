# Face-Recognition-with-FaceNet

ðŸ“Œ Overview of FaceNet
FaceNet is a deep convolutional neural network developed by Google researchers Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko, and James Philbin. It learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face similarity. This approach enables efficient face recognition, verification, and clustering. The model is trained using a triplet loss function, which minimizes the distance between embeddings of the same identity and maximizes the distance between embeddings of different identities. â€‹

ðŸ§ª Notebook Workflow
1. Face Detection
The notebook begins by detecting faces in images using the MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) model. This step ensures that only the face regions are processed, improving the accuracy of subsequent steps.â€‹

2. Face Embedding Generation
After detecting faces, the notebook uses the FaceNet model to generate 128-dimensional embeddings for each face. These embeddings serve as compact representations of the faces, capturing essential features for recognition tasks.â€‹


3. Data Preparation
The embeddings are then organized into training and validation datasets. The training set is used to train the SVM classifier, while the validation set evaluates its performance.â€‹

4. Classifier Training
A Linear SVM classifier is trained using the face embeddings. The SVM is effective in separating the embeddings of different individuals, leveraging the high-dimensional feature space provided by FaceNet embeddings. â€‹

5. Model Evaluation
The trained classifier is evaluated on the validation set, and its accuracy is reported. This step assesses the model's ability to correctly identify individuals based on the face embeddings.â€‹
